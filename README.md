# pyePuck for robotBox
This is an adapted version of the [pyePuck](https://github.com/mmartinortiz/pyePuck) library to control the e-puck robot
on the [robotBox](https://github.com/ibonn/robotBox) simulator.
The usage is exactly the same, so you don't have to change your code when you use it with with a real e-puck
